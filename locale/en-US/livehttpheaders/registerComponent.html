<BODY>
To be able to display headers information in the PageInfo tab of
Mozilla or Firebird the nsHeaderInfo component must be registered.<br>
This component should be found in the file Mozilla/Components/nsHeaderInfo.js.<p>

Registration should have been done by the LiveHTTPHeaders installation.<br>
However this sometimes does not work.<br>
Follow these steps to enable Mozilla or Firebird to find and register the
component:<br>
<ul>
<li>Delete the file <code><b>Mozilla/Components/compreg.dat</b></code></li>
<li>Delete the file <code><b>Mozilla/Components/xpti.dat</b></code></li>
</ul>
These two files should be recreated automatically by Mozilla or Firebird
when it is next started.
